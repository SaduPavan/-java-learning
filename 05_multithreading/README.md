# Java Multithreading and Concurrency

This section covers everything you need to know about multithreading and concurrency in Java.

## Topics Covered

1. [Thread Basics](thread_basics.md)
   - Thread Lifecycle
   - Creating Threads
   - Thread Methods
   - Thread Priorities

2. [Synchronization](synchronization.md)
   - Synchronized Methods
   - Synchronized Blocks
   - Locks
   - Deadlock Prevention

3. [Thread Pools](thread_pools.md)
   - Executor Framework
   - ThreadPoolExecutor
   - ScheduledExecutorService
   - Best Practices

4. [Concurrent Collections](concurrent_collections.md)
   - ConcurrentHashMap
   - BlockingQueue
   - CopyOnWriteArrayList
   - Atomic Classes

## Prerequisites

Before starting this section, make sure you understand:
- Basic Java programming
- Object-oriented concepts
- Exception handling

## Learning Path

1. Start with Thread Basics to understand fundamental concepts
2. Move to Synchronization to learn about thread safety
3. Study Thread Pools for efficient thread management
4. Finally, explore Concurrent Collections for thread-safe data structures

## Code Examples

Each topic includes practical code examples. For instance:

```java
// Thread creation
Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
    System.out.println("Thread running");
});
thread.start();

// Thread pool usage
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);
executor.submit(() -> {
    // Task code here
});
```

## Best Practices

1. Always use thread pools instead of creating threads manually
2. Properly handle exceptions in threads
3. Use appropriate synchronization mechanisms
4. Be aware of deadlock possibilities
5. Use concurrent collections when needed

## Common Pitfalls

1. Race conditions
2. Deadlocks
3. Thread leaks
4. Over-synchronization
5. Improper exception handling

## Exercises

1. Create a thread-safe counter
2. Implement a producer-consumer pattern
3. Build a thread pool for file processing
4. Create a concurrent cache

## Next Steps

After completing this section, you should:
1. Understand thread lifecycle and management
2. Be able to implement thread-safe code
3. Know when and how to use thread pools
4. Be familiar with concurrent collections
5. Understand common concurrency issues and solutions
